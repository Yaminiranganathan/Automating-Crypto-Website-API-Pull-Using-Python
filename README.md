## Automating Crypto Website API Pull Using Python

## Objective

**The major objectives of the project are as follows:**

- To fetch real-time data of the latest cryptocurrency listings from CoinMarketCap.
- To display the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization in USD.
- To handle common exceptions such as connection errors, timeouts, and too many redirects.

## Existing System

- In the existing system, users manually visit cryptocurrency listing websites like CoinMarketCap to check the latest prices and details.
- Data is often viewed in a browser and manually processed or entered into spreadsheets.
- Users have to manually refresh the page or visit frequently to get updated data.

## Proposed System

- The proposed system automates the process of fetching the latest cryptocurrency listings.
- By using the CoinMarketCap API, the system retrieves real-time data and displays the top 15 cryptocurrencies.
- This system can handle errors like connection issues, timeouts, and too many redirects gracefully, ensuring robust data retrieval.
- It can be integrated into various applications, providing live updates on cryptocurrency listings without manual intervention.

### Features
